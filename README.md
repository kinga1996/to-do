# To do list

##### What does it do?
This is a classic website that allows you to add new tasks that you need to do. It is possible to delete tasks and mark their completion.

##### How does the website work?
I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript to make the page. The site uses local storage to remember the entered duties and their completion even after closing the page.

##### Where did I get the idea for this website?
The beginning of the project was made during the "30-day JavaScript Challenge", but I expanded the project with the possibility of removing, marking and deselecting all tasks (also from local storage), and changed the style of the site.
